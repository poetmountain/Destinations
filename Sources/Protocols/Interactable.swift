/// This protocol represents Interactors that handle requests using a synchronous context, typically providing results for requests via a ``InteractorResponseClosure``.
///
/// Interactors provide an interface to perform some business logic, often acting as a datasource by interfacing with an API, handling system APIs, or some other self-contained work.
///
///  The concept of Interactors comes from [Clean Swift](https://clean-swift.com), used in its architecture as a way to move logic and datasource management out of view controllers. In Destinations, the `Interactable` protocol represents Interactor objects which provide an interface to perform some logic or data request, typically by interfacing with an backend API, handling system APIs, or some other self-contained work. `Datasourceable` inherits from this protocol and should be used for objects which specifically represent a datasource of some kind. There are also Actor-based async versions of these protocols available.
///
///  Though requests to Interactors can be made using a Destination's `performRequest` method, in general one should use the `performInterfaceAction` method. This abstracts the specific implementation details of an interactor away from the interface and lets it focus on making requests through a standardized request.
///
///  The recommended way is to assign a user interaction type to your request and using an `InteractorAssisting`-conforming assistant to configure the request, leaving the Destination's interface free of associated business logic.
///
///  Interactors are typically created by Destination providers and stored in the Destination. Like with presentations of new Destinations, Interactor requests are associated with a particular `InterfaceAction` object and are represented by an `InteractorConfiguration` model object. Action types for each Interactor are defined as enums, keeping Interactor-specific knowledge out of the interface.
///
///  For example, here we're creating an Interactor action for making a pagination request to the ColorsDatasource, and then assign it to a `moreButton` user interaction type:
///  ```swift
///  let paginateAction = InteractorConfiguration<ColorsListProvider.InteractorType, ColorsDatasource>(interactorType: .colors, actionType: .paginate, assistantType: .basic)
///  let colorsProvider = ColorsListProvider(interactorsData: [.moreButton: paginateAction])
///  ```
///
/// And here is that user interaction type being called by a Destination's interface. Note that `performInterfaceAction` can throw and the Destination method `handleThrowable` automatically handles that for you, logging any errors to the console with the built-in Logger class.
/// ```swift
/// destination().handleThrowable {
///    try destination().performInterfaceAction(interactionType: .moreButton)
/// }
/// ```

    /// A dictionary of Interactor request responses, whose keys are the Interactor action type they are associated with.
